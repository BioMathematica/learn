# Stage 2: all observations on a subset of predictions

Here's a description of this stage quoting from the [project report](https://thinklab.com/doc/7/review#section-83):

> Based on the all-features [performance assessment](https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d115), we selected 142 DWPCs to compute on all observations (all 209,168 compoundâ€“disease pairs). The feature selection was designed to remove uninformative features (according to permutation) and guard against [edge-dropout contamination](https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d215). Third, we included 14 degree features, which assess the degree of a specific metaedge for either the source compound or target disease.
